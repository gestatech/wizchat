#Wizchat: A sample Dropwizard chat application

##Why?
I'm writing a series exploring Dropwizard to see what all the fuss is about.  Here are the articles published so far:

- [Modern Java Web Development from the start: Dropwizard](https://dzone.com/articles/modern-java-web-dev-dropwizard-from-the-start-part)
- [Using progressive enhancement to build a chat application](https://dzone.com/articles/using-tdd-and-progressive-enhancement-to-build-a-c)

##How?
Simply download the source code and run WizChatApplication.  In it's current format, you need to head to 
http://localhost:8080/chats/aUsername/anotherUsername and the chat will begin.  

##What's missing?
Almost everything at this point; it exists as a simple and functional chat app.  The 2 main things missing (and 
coming in articles shortly) are:

- Persistance
- Login
